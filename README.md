# Clean Architecture Template with ASP.NET v6
This solution presents a robust implementation of the [Clean Architecture] Principles using ASP.NET Core, following the principles of domain-driven design. By adhering to these principles, the codebase is structured in a way that promotes modularization, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Overview
The Core section serves as the focal point of the Clean Architecture design, with all other project dependencies directed towards it. As a result, it relies on minimal external dependencies. The Core is responsible for encapsulating the Domain Model.
### Domain
The Domain layer encompasses a collection of essential business domain objects, including entities, contracts, data transfer objects (DTOs), and enums. It is crucial for the Domain layer to be independent and decoupled from other layers.
### Application
The Application layer is responsible for housing the business logic of the system. It depends solely on the Domain layer for its functionality. In this solution, logic implementation is carried out through services. Alternatively, you can consider utilizing the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern within this layer.
### Infrastructure
The Infrastructure layer encompasses classes that handle the interaction with external resources, such as file systems, web services, SMTP, and more.
### Presentation
The Presentation section is responsible for providing various services, such as REST APIs, GraphQL, and more. It can also include web UI projects.
